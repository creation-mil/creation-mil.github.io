# Time Study Helper
This site is a web-based tool designed to help users track elapsed time for various processes. This mini-project was created at an internship, where I was tasked with calculating cycle times of various manufacturing processes.

This project helped me improve my front-end development skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create functional applications.

## Features
The application includes features for starting, pausing, stopping, and resetting timers, as well as exporting time logs to a CSV file for further analysis.

* Standard timer controls such as Start, Pause, and Stop.
* Data-table to track start, stop, and elapsed time.
* Export to CSV Functionality for further data analysis.
